### Background Colours.
Greys as a background is a little abnormal but it gives you the ability to use blacks and whites in ways you otherwise coudnt.
Here is a selection of nice greys that would make nice background colours:
- ANTI-FLASH White: #F2F2F2
- CULTURED: #F5F5F5
- BRIGHT GREY: #EEEEEE

### Text Colours
Often just white or black. But I find other shades can make text more pleasant.

- PRIMARY TEXT: 313131
- HEADER OR LABEL TEXT: 616161
- SECONDARY: 919191
- DISABLED: C2C2C2

### Fonts we like.
I really love 
- DIDOT: Font-family: Didot, Didot LT STD, Hoefler Text, Garamond, Calisto MT, Times New Roman, serif.
Didot is a font inspired by the original Didot typefaces, used by 19th-century French printing business   

- CONSOLAS: Consolas, monaco, monospace
Consolas is a sans serif font with a unique approach to design. All characters have the same width, which is why it uses serifs only for the letter “I” and the lowercase “l”. It’s part of the ClearType collection.

- GARAMOND: Font-family: Garamond, Baskerville, Baskerville Old Face, Hoefler Text, Times New Roman, serif.
Garamond is a serif font, inspired by typefaces made by the 16th-century Parisian engraver, Claude Garamond. It has softer, rounder edges than some of the more standard serif fonts, like Times New Roman. Modern versions of Microsoft and Apple OS include their own versions of the Garamond font.

Apple mainstay
- BASKERVILLE: Font-family: Perpetua, Baskerville, Big Caslon, Palatino Linotype, Palatino, serif;
Perpetua is a serif font with a unique design, originally created by English sculptor Eric Gill. There’s a sharp contrast in the stroke weight, for example, look at the lowercase “e” or the number “3”. This gives the font a creative, almost playful quality. It’s typically a Windows font, but Baskerville, a close relative, is standard on most Apple devices.
