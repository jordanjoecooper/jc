# List of exaplantions, notes and ideas.

- No frameworks.
- HTML, CSS & JS ony, where possible CSS first.
- Site must work with JS turned off (maybe)?
- Keep it light the goal is under 2kb excluding images, forever.

### Background Colours.
Greys as a background is a little abnormal but it gives you the ability to use blacks and whites in ways you otherwise coudnt.
Here is a selection of nice greys that would make nice background colours:
- ANTI-FLASH White: #F2F2F2
- CULTURED: #F5F5F5
- BRIGHT GREY: #EEEEEE

### Text Colours
Often just white or black. But I find other shades can make text more pleasant.

- PRIMARY TEXT: 313131
- HEADER OR LABEL TEXT: 616161
- SECONDARY: 919191
- DISABLED: C2C2C2

### Font.
- CONSOLAS: Consolas, monaco, monospace
Consolas is a sans serif font with a unique approach to design. All characters have the same width, which is why it uses serifs only for the letter “I” and the lowercase “l”. It’s part of the ClearType collection.

- BASKERVILLE: Font-family: Perpetua, Baskerville, Big Caslon, Palatino Linotype, Palatino, serif;
Perpetua is a serif font with a unique design, originally created by English sculptor Eric Gill. There’s a sharp contrast in the stroke weight, for example, look at the lowercase “e” or the number “3”. This gives the font a creative, almost playful quality. It’s typically a Windows font, but Baskerville, a close relative, is standard on most Apple devices.
