          <h1 class="landingBoxHeading">About</h1>
          <p class="landingBoxSubHeading">I am a problem solver at heart. That somehow manifested itself in programming more than anything. I like looking at how society uses technology both in a useful ways but more so in how its misused and thus the main benefit it can provide is discarded at the side of the road.</p>
